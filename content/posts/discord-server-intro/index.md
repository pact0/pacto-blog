# What's this for?
I decided to make a discord server dedicated to TFT tools which I develop
just so that users can easily request more features and report bugs.

## Dyno forms

I created some Dyno forms

* [TFT Trade Extension Improvement](https://dyno.gg/form/7c6d2d45)
* [TFT Trade Extension Issue](https://dyno.gg/form/42b1bf6d)

## General Purpose Discord

You can of course use this discord to chat with other members! I will be creating
more sections and adding more features in time when people start joining.

## Roadmaps

I will be posting planned features and small updates of what
I am currently working on.
