Introduction post!

# Hello World!

## Why do this?

The main goal of creating this blog is well... to get more motivation.

I want to start documenting the development of my tools, provide constant updates and guides. I still plan on making video guides for upcoming tool updates but some people might prefer a written guide so that's where you can find them.


## How do this

This blog is powered by 
{{< figure src="/images/hugo-image.png" title="Hugo" link="https://gohugo.io/" >}}

This is just a static website which is generated using this awesome tool. I really enjoyed setting this up. It was really quick and easy. It's also easy to host such websites on github for free. 

## What you can find here


Hugo provides a ton of features and it is really easy to for example post code snippets, pictures or embed videos. 
{{< highlight cpp >}}

int main(){
    return 0;
}

{{< /highlight >}}
